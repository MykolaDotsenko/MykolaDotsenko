## 🚀 About me

I build and improve web applications with a practical, product-oriented mindset.  
My current work includes data-heavy features, integrations, validation flows, and performance optimization.

Before switching to software development, I worked in Agronomy, Sales, and Accounting. That background shaped my structured, ownership-driven approach and helps me translate business needs into clear technical solutions.

I also enjoy applied AI experiments for development workflows, automation, and productivity.

🏡 Outside of work, I’m a family man and father to a little princess. I love nature and travel, and I’m passionate about photography (manual shooting with different lenses). I also enjoy fishing, motorcycle rides, and good old rock music.
