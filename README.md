# Hi, I'm Mykola👋

**Full-Stack Software Developer** based in Finland (Turku)  
**Python / Django + React / Next.js + PostgreSQL**  
Focused on building reliable web products with strong performance, data consistency, and long-term maintainability.

## About me

I build and improve web applications with a practical, product-oriented mindset.  
My current work includes data-heavy features, integrations, validation flows, and performance optimization.

Before switching to software development, I worked in Agronomy, Sales, and Accounting. That background shaped my structured, ownership-driven approach and helps me translate business needs into clear technical solutions.

I also enjoy applied AI experiments for development workflows, automation, and productivity.

## What I’m working on

- Building and maintaining search, filtering, listing, and detail views in production web apps
- Improving performance (ORM optimization, caching, N+1 fixes)
- Implementing integrations and validation pipelines to keep business data consistent
- Strengthening reliability with automated tests, type hints, and static analysis
